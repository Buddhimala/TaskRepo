Role based access Token generation

With single scope:

curl -k -d "grant_type=password&username=admin1&password=admin1&scope=AllUser_Key" \
	    -H "Authorization: Basic dXhON2Nld3hWaGZQZmpJVnlMNnROeXBSRkhvYTpWeUg4YTRMaEl4YnFsV2hrYXdOUXJfdWFINTBh" \
	     https://172.17.0.1:8244/token

With multiple scope:

curl -k -d "grant_type=password&username=admin1&password=admin1&scope=AllUser_Key Admin_Key" \
	    -H "Authorization: Basic dXhON2Nld3hWaGZQZmpJVnlMNnROeXBSRkhvYTpWeUg4YTRMaEl4YnFsV2hrYXdOUXJfdWFINTBh" \
	     https://172.17.0.1:8244/token

Approach:

In order to implement the given scenario, I have followed the given steps at each stage and the synapse configuration for each of the step can be found using the given projects.

1.As the first step, I needed to get an idea on the BE opertions available, the request and response structure etc.So that, I invoked the given secured BE using SOAPUI.There are two different ways of invoking UT secured BE.

	i) We can define the username/password under the Authorization tab and send the request.(Refer to the SOAP project SOAPBE)
	ii)We can add wsse:Security headers into the request. For this, in the Request Properties pane of SOAPUI project, specify the following four properties.
		username
		password
		WSS-Password Type:PasswordText
		WSS TimetoLive:2000
	
	(Refer to SOAP project SOAPBE2)

2. Then I tried to invoke the secured BE using a proxy service in wso2 ESB. Here I'm passing username/password as HTTP basic authentication header from the esb using the property

<property name="Authorization" scope="transport" value="Basic YnVkZGhpbWFsYTpidWRkaGltYWxhMTIz"/>

(Refer to the proxy service "NawalokaPatientService" for the synapse configuration.SOAPUI project:"NawalokaPatientService")

3.Since it gives an error with the POST method which is defined as IN-ONLY operation in the wsdl, I added the property

<property name="OUT_ONLY" value="true" scope="default" type="STRING"/>

into the proxy service.(Refer the proxy service "NawalokaPatientServiceproxy" for synapse configuration.SOAPUI project:"NawalokaPatientServiceProxy")

4.Since we cannot use that property alone as no response is showing to the customer and on customer side it keeps hanging, the proxy service was modified as per "ModifiedNawalokaPatientServiceProxy".
Added property: <property name="FORCE_SC_ACCEPTED" scope="axis2" value="true"/>

(Refer to the SOAP project "ModifiedNawalokaPatientServiceProxy".SOAPUI project:"ModifiedNawalokaPatientServiceProxy")

5.Created a proxy service in ESB to implement different operations based on the HTTP METHOD. (REST project:"DirectAccessProxy")

6.Created API and a proxy in ESB and integrate them to implement different operations for CRUD operations.

(Synapse configuration:"ESBResource" REST project:"ESBResource" API:NawalokaPatientService Application:Nawaloka)

7.Implemented securing the proxy service created. (UT policy was added. Policy file can be found in gov/sample_policy.xml)

(Synapse Configuration:"SecuredESBResource" REST project:"SecuredESBResource" API:Nawaloka1 Application:Nawaloka1)

8.Added role based restricted access

(API:NawalokaPatientService1 Application:NawalokaApplication1 SOAP:AddedUserRoles)

9.Edited the proxy service to customize the response based on the role.(Since we cannot do further changes with a secured proxy, for the moment I haven't added the securying code part for the proxy service.)

(Synapse configuration:ModifiedSecuredESBResource API:NawalokaPatientService2 Application:NawalokaApplication2 SOAP:NawalokaApplication2)

10.Modified NawalokaPatientService2 to add IP based throttling.

11.Caching Implementation
